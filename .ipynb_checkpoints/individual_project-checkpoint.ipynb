    "## (1) Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project are from the UBC Computer Science research group that studies player behaviour on a customized Minecraft server. There are two datasets: players.csv and sessions.csv. Together, they record how players interact with the game and provide basic information about each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "players.csv  \n",
    "- Number of observations: 196 \n",
    "- Number of variables: 7  \n",
    "- Each row represents one player  \n",
    "Variables include:\n",
    "- experience (chr): level of previous game experience (Pro, Veteran, Amatuer, Regular or Beginner)\n",
    "- subscribe (lgl): whether the player subscribed to the newsletter (TRUE or FALSE)\n",
    "- hashedEmail (chr): unique player identifier that connects to sessions.csv\n",
    "- played_hours (dbl): total number of hours the player has spent playing\n",
    "- name (chr): player’s in-game name\n",
    "- gender (chr): self-identified gender (Female, Male, Non-binary, Agender, Two-spirited, Prefer not to say or Other)\n",
    "- age (dbl): age of the player in years\n",
    "  \n",
    "sessions.csv  \n",
    "- Number of observations: 1,535  \n",
    "- Number of variables: 5  \n",
    "- Each row represents one play session  \n",
    "Variables include:\n",
    "- hashedEmail (chr): unique player identifier that connects to players.csv\n",
    "- start_time (chr): when a play session began\n",
    "- end_time (chr): when a play session ended\n",
    "- original_start_time (dbl): unadjusted session start time\n",
    "- original_end_time (dbl): unadjusted session end time\n",
    "\n",
    "From these two datasets, I can also create new variables such as:  \n",
    "- session_duration = end_time - start_time  \n",
    "- sessions_per_player = number of sessions per player  \n",
    "- peak_play_hour = hour of day when most sessions occur  \n",
    "\n",
    "Issues seen in the data:  \n",
    "- Missing values in gender and experience columns  \n",
    "- Some inconsistencies in how timestamps are formatted (for example, different date and time styles or incomplete timestamps)  \n",
    "- Possible duplicate or mismatched player IDs between datasets  \n",
    "- Since the timestamp data were collected through automated server logs, it will be important to check for errors like duplicates, inconsistent IDs, or missing records that can happen in automated systems  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other potential issues:  \n",
    "- Data may be incomplete due to players disconnecting or server interruptions  \n",
    "- Some variables might not be updated regularly, which could affect accuracy  \n",
    "\n",
    "How the data were collected:  \n",
    "- All information was automatically recorded by the Minecraft research server as players interacted with the game.  \n",
    "- Player details such as gender, experience, and email were collected during registration, and session details were logged whenever a player joined or left the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## (2) Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Broad question (1):\n",
    "What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific question:  \n",
    "Can experience, gender, and played_hours predict whether a player subscribed to the newsletter?\n",
    "\n",
    "How the data will help:  \n",
    "- Compare subscription behaviour across experience groups\n",
    "- Check whether gender influences subscription rates\n",
    "- Explore whether players who spend more time playing are more likely to subscribe\n",
    "- Later, we can use a logistic regression model to analyze whether experince, gender and played hours can predict subsription status\n",
    "- Another thing that is helpful is that all the data for this specific question is within the players.csv dataset so we don't need to do any merging of datasets\n",
